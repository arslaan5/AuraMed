# Medical Chatbot - Student Project Outline

## Project Overview
**Goal**: Build a medical chatbot as a learning project to demonstrate full-stack development, AI integration, and healthcare domain knowledge.

**Tech Stack**: Python + FastAPI, React, PostgreSQL, Vector DB (ChromaDB), OpenAI API

**Timeline**: 8-12 weeks (part-time development)

---

## Core Features (Simplified)

### 1. User Management
- Simple registration/login (email + password)
- User profile with basic info
- Session management with JWT tokens

### 2. Prescription Analysis
- Upload prescription images (JPG/PNG)
- Basic OCR using Tesseract
- Extract medication names and dosages
- Display parsed results for user verification

### 3. Drug Information System
- Search drugs by name
- Display basic info (uses, dosage, side effects)
- Use free APIs like OpenFDA or create a simple database
- Support both generic and brand names

### 4. Drug Interaction Checker
- Check interactions between 2-3 medications
- Simple severity levels (Low/Medium/High)
- Basic warnings and recommendations
- Use open-source drug interaction data

### 5. Disease Information
- Search diseases by name or symptoms
- Basic disease descriptions
- Common treatments and prevention tips
- Simple symptom-to-disease matching

### 6. AI Chat Interface
- Natural language queries about medications/diseases
- Integration with OpenAI API (GPT-3.5-turbo for cost efficiency)
- Basic conversation memory (last 5-10 messages)
- Safety disclaimers for all medical advice

## Simplified Architecture

```
React Frontend ↔ FastAPI Backend ↔ PostgreSQL Database
                        ↓
                   External APIs:
                   • OpenAI (Chat)
                   • Tesseract (OCR)
                   • Medical APIs
```

**No need for**: Microservices, Kubernetes, complex caching, etc.

## Simplified Tech Requirements

### Backend (Python + FastAPI)
```python
FastAPI
LangGraph
LangSmith

```

### Frontend (React)
```javascript
// Key dependencies:
react, react-dom, react-router-dom
axios (for API calls)
material-ui or tailwindcss (styling)
react-hook-form (forms)
```

### Database Schema (Simple)
```sql
-- Users
users (id, email, password_hash, created_at)

-- Drugs (can start with a simple table)
drugs (id, name, description, uses, side_effects)

-- Prescriptions
prescriptions (id, user_id, file_path, parsed_text, created_at)

-- Chat history
conversations (id, user_id, message, response, created_at)
```

## Realistic Scope & Expectations

### What to Include:
- Basic functionality for all 6 features
- Simple but clean UI
- Working demo with sample data
- Basic error handling
- Simple documentation

### What to Skip (for now):
- Advanced security (HIPAA compliance)
- Complex drug interaction algorithms
- Real-time features
- Mobile app
- Advanced analytics
- Production deployment complexity

### Success Criteria:
- All features work with sample data
- Can demo the full user journey
- Code is clean and documented
- Good portfolio piece
- Learn key technologies

## Development Tips

### Start Simple:
1. Get basic CRUD operations working first
2. Use mock data before integrating real APIs
3. Focus on one feature at a time
4. Don't over-engineer initially

### Free Resources:
- **Drug Data**: OpenFDA API, RxNav API
- **Disease Info**: MedlinePlus API, UMLS
- **OCR**: Tesseract (free, open-source)
- **AI**: OpenAI free tier, Hugging Face models
- **Hosting**: Render, Railway (free tiers)

## Next Steps

1. **Week 1**: Set up basic project structure and authentication
2. **Week 2**: Create simple drug search functionality
3. **Week 3**: Add prescription upload and basic OCR
4. **Week 4**: Integrate OpenAI for chat functionality
5. **Ongoing**: Iterative improvement and feature additions

**Remember**: This is a learning project - focus on understanding the concepts and building something that works rather than creating a production-ready system!
